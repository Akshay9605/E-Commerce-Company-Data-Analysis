# E-Commerce-Company-Data-Analysis
## Objective 
The E-commerce Company wants to know insights about its marketing strategy. The data includes the tables Online sales, customer data, marketing spend, discount coupon and tax amount.
We need to find out the current position of customer and insight in order to predict sales.

## Technology Used
MySQL

We shall use MySQL workbench for data analysis. Before moving further our first task is to check the data compatibility of the tables for importing data into MySQL using **Table Import Wizard**.
1. The columns names should not have spaces within them. Instead of spaces we shall insert underscore(_).
2. The date format should be in "YYYY-MM-DD". So we shall change the date format.
